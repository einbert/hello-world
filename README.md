# hello-world
first github project

JOSHUA WILLIAMS
I went to school at Troy University
Studied Applied Computer Science
But I have been programming since I was eleven years old
Started with QUICKBASIC, now I do many languages
This is my GitHub, where I will sharpen
My skills and show off some work.
